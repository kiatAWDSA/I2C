I2C.h   - I2C library
Copyright (c) 2011-2012 Wayne Truchsess.  All right reserved.
Rev 5.0 - January 24th, 2012
- Removed the use of interrupts completely from the library
so TWI state changes are now polled.
- Added calls to lockup() function in most functions
to combat arbitration problems
- Fixed scan() procedure which left timeouts enabled
and set to 80msec after exiting procedure
- Changed scan() address range back to 0 - 0x7F
- Removed all Wire legacy functions from library
- A big thanks to Richard Baldwin for all the testing
and feedback with debugging bus lockups!
Rev 4.0 - January 14th, 2012
- Updated to make compatible with 8MHz clock frequency
Rev 3.0 - January 9th, 2012
- Modified library to be compatible with Arduino 1.0
- Changed argument type from boolean to uint8_t in pullUp(),
setSpeed() and receiveByte() functions for 1.0 compatability
- Modified return values for timeout feature to report
back where in the transmission the timeout occured.
- added function scan() to perform a bus scan to find devices
attached to the I2C bus.  Similar to work done by Todbot
and Nick Gammon
Rev 2.0 - September 19th, 2011
- Added support for timeout function to prevent
and recover from bus lockup (thanks to PaulS
and CrossRoads on the Arduino forum)
- Changed return type for stop() from void to
uint8_t to handle timeOut function
Rev 1.0 - August 8th, 2011

This is a modified version of the Arduino Wire/TWI
library.  Functions were rewritten to provide more functionality
and also the use of Repeated Start.  Some I2C devices will not
function correctly without the use of a Repeated Start.  The
initial version of this library only supports the Master.

Modified by Soon Kiat Lau (2019):
- massive revamp to incorporate error codes, improve reuseability of functions and enhance human readability
- ping function
- added additional read/write functions to ignore the read/write register
- allow user to enable/disable internal pull-up resistors in begin()

  // standard strictly, and sometimes a "command" is sent instead of the address of the register. Still, the "registerAddress" variable is simply a byte
  // that is sent out right after the write/read byte, therefore it can be replaced with any byte such as a command byte or whatever your device needs to send
  // immediately after the write/read byte. The "data" is simply the third byte in the whole command train. Any additional bytes can be stuffed into an array
  // and sent out with the function using *data.
  //
  // This is how the entire command train looks like:
  // [address+read/write byte] -> ["registerAddress" byte] -> [data (if available) OR *data (sends out one byte for each array entry)]
